SMA Conversion/Tagging Automation Script
==============

**Automatically converts media files downloaded by various programs to a standardized format, and tags them with the appropriate metadata from TMDB if the container supports tagging.**

- https://hub.docker.com/r/mdhiggins/sonarr-sma
- https://hub.docker.com/r/mdhiggins/radarr-sma

General Configuration
--------------
1. Download or compile FFmpeg 
2. Rename `setup\autoProcess.ini.sample` to `autoProcess.ini` and place inside your `config` directory (or attempt to run the script which will generate a new config file if absent)
3. Set the [configuration options](https://github.com/mdhiggins/sickbeard_mp4_automator/wiki/autoProcess-Settings) to your desired output and include the path of your new FFmpeg / FFprobe binaries
4. Run [manual.py](#manual-script-usage) and test out a conversion
5. Configure direct integration using the instructions below

Sonarr Setup
--------------
1. Set your [Sonarr settings](https://github.com/mdhiggins/sickbeard_mp4_automator/wiki/autoProcess-Settings#sonarr) in autoProcess.ini
2. Browse to the Settings>Download Client tab and enable advanced settings [Show].
3. Setup the postSonarr.py script via Settings > Connect > Connections > + (Add)
    - `name` - postSonarr
    - `On Grab` - No
    - `On Download` \ `On Import` - Yes

Plex Notification
--------------
Send a Plex notification as the final step when all processing is completed. This feature prevents a file from being flagged as "in use" by Plex before processing has completed.
1. Disable automatic refreshing on your Plex server
    - `Settings > Server > Library` and disable `Update my library automatically` and `Update my library periodically`.
3. Set your [Plex settings](https://github.com/mdhiggins/sickbeard_mp4_automator/wiki/autoProcess-Settings#plex) in autoProcess.ini

If you have secure connections enabled with Plex you will need to add your local IP addresss that the refresh requests are coming from to allow them to trigger the refresh, otherwise you will get an HTTP error. You can alternatively not force encryption by changing `Secure Connections` from `Required` to `Preferred` but this is not recommended as its less secure.

Found under Plex Server Settings > Network > Advanced

Override Configuration Path
--------------
If for some reason you need to override the path to autoProcess.ini (for virtual environments, containers, etc) you can use the environment variable `SMA_CONFIG` to the absolute path

Post Process Scripts
--------------
The script suite supports the ability to write your own post processing scripts that will be executed when all the final processing has been completed. All scripts in the `./post_process` directory will be executed if the `post-process` option is set to `True` in `autoProcess.ini`. Scripts within the `./post_process/resources` directory are protected from execution if additional script resources are required.

The following environmental variables are available for usage:
- `SMA_FILES` - JSON Array of all files created by the post processing script. The first file in the array is the primary file, and any additional files are copies created by the copy-to option
- `SMA_TVDBID` - TVDB ID if file processed was a TV show and this information is available
- `SMA_SEASON` - Season number if file processed was a TV show
- `SMA_EPISODE` - Episode number if files processed was a TV show
- `SMA_IMDBID` - IMDB ID if file processed was a movie
A sample script as well as an OS X 'Add to iTunes' script (`iTunes.py`) have been provided.

*Special thanks to @jzucker2 for providing much of the initial code for this feature*

Manual Script Usage
--------------
To run the script manually, simply run the manual.py file and follow the prompts it presents.
If you wish to run it via the command line (good for batch operations) follow this format:

```
Help output
manual.py -h
usage: manual.py [-h] [-i INPUT] [-a] [-tv TVDBID] [-s SEASON] [-e EPISODE]

```

Examples
```
Movies (using IMDB ID):
manual.py -i mp4path -imdb imdbid
Example: manual.py -i "C:\The Matrix.mkv" -imdb tt0133093

Movies (using TMDB ID)
manual.py -i mp4path -tmdb tmdbid
Example: manual.py -i "C:\The Matrix.mkv" -tmdb 603

TV
manual.py -i mp4path -tvdb tmbdid -s season -e episode
Example: manual.py -i "C:\Futurama S03E10.mkv" -tvdb 73871‎ -s 3 -e 10

Auto Single File (will gather movie ID or TV show ID / season / spisode from the file name if possible)
manual.py -i mp4path -a
Example: manual.py -i "C:\Futurama S03E10.mkv" -a

Directory (you will be prompted at each file for the type of file and ID)
manual.py -i directory_path
Example: manual.py -i C:\Movies

Automated Directory (The script will attempt to figure out appropriate tagging based on file name)
manual.py -i directory_path -a
Example: manual.py -i C:\Movies -a

Process a directory but manually specific TVDB ID (Good for shows that don't correctly match using the guess)
manual.py -i directory -a -tvdb tvdbid
Example: manual.py -i C:\TV\Futurama\ -a -tvdb 615
```
You may also simply run `manual.py -i 'C:\The Matrix.mkv` and the script will prompt you for the missing information or attempt to guess based on the file name.
You may run the script with a `--auto` or `-a` switch, which will let the script guess the tagging information based on the file name, avoiding any need for user input. This is the most ideal option for large batch file operations.
The script may also be pointed to a directory, where it will process all files in the directory. If you run the script without the `-a` switch, you will be prompted for each file with options on how to tag, to convert without tagging, or skip.

External Cover Art
--------------
To use your own cover art instead of what the script pulls from TMDB or TVDB, simply place an image file  in the same directory as the input video with the same name before processing and it will be used. Must be `jpg` or `png`

Import External Subtitles
--------------
To import external subtitles, place the .srt file in the same directory as the file to be processed. The srt must have the same name as the input video file, as well as the language code for which the subtitle is. Subtitle importing obeys the langauge rules set in autoProcess.ini, so languages that aren't whitelisted will be ignored.

Naming example:
```
input mkv - The.Matrix.1999.mkv
subtitle srt - The.Matrix.1999.eng.srt
```
