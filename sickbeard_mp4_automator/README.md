General MP4 Configuration
--------------
1. Rename autoProcess.ini.sample to autoProcess.ini
2. Set the MP4 variables to your desired output
    - `ffmpeg` = Full path to FFMPEG.exe
    - `ffprobe` = Full path to FFPROBE.exe
    - `threads` = Number of threads for FFMPEG to use, default "auto"
    - `output_directory` = you may specify an alternate output directory. Leave blank to use the same directory that the source file is in. All processing will be done in this location. (Do not use for 'Automatically Add to iTunes' folder, iTunes will add prematurely, use `move_to`)
    - `copy_to` = you may specify additional directories for the final product to be replicated to. This will be the last step performed so the file copied will be fully processed. Directories may be separated with a `|` character
    - `move_to` = you may specify one final directory to move the completed file. (Use this option for the 'Automatically Add to iTunes' folder)
    - `output_extension` = mp4/m4v (must be one of these 2)
    - `output_format` = mp4/mov (must be one of these 2, mov provides better compatibility with iTunes/Apple, mp4 works better with other mobile devices)
    - `delete_original` = True/False
    - `relocate_moov` = True/False - relocates the MOOV atom to the beginning of the file for better streaming
    - `ios-audio` = creates a 2nd copy of an audio stream that will be iOS compatible (AAC Stereo) if the normal output will not be. If a stereo source stream is detected with this option enabled, an AAC stereo stream will be the only one produced (essentially overriding the codec option) to avoid multiple stereo audio stream copies in different codecs. Instead of 'true' you may also set this option to a specific codec to override the default.
    - `ios-first-track-only` = Applies the `ios-audio` option only to the first audio track encountered in the source video file. This prevents making dual audio streams for additional alternative language codecs or commentary tracks that may be present in the source file.
    - `ios-audio-filter` = Applies FFMPEG audio filter option to ONLY the iOS audio channels created by the script. iOS audio counterpart to the `audio-filter` option below.
    - `ios-move-last` = Rearranges the iOS audio track to be after the converted track instead of first and changes the default disposition accordingly
    - `max-audio-channels` = Sets a maximum number of audio channels. This may provide an alternative to the iOS audio option, where instead users can simply select the desired output codec and the max number of audio channels without the creation of an additional audio track.
    - `enable_dxva2_gpu_decode` = Enable GPU decoding by using DXVA2 - Windows only. Will automatically fallback to cpu decoding when it encounters a video that it cannot decode due to unsupported pixel/color/codec.
    - `video-codec` = set your desired video codecs. May specify multiple comma separated values (ex: h264, x264). The first value specified will be the default conversion choice when an undesired codec is encountered; any codecs specified here will be remuxed/copied rather than converted.
    - `video-bitrate` = allows you to set a maximum video bitrate in Kbps. If the source file exceeds the video-bitrate it will be transcoded to the specified video-bitrate, even if they source file is already in the correct video codec. If the source file is in the correct video codec and does not exceed the video-bitrate setting, then it will be copied without transcoding. Leave blank to disable this setting.
    - `video-crf` = allows you to set the CRF which will override the video bitrate setting for those that prefer CRF. Video-bitrate setting will still be used to determine a maximum bitrate that will trigger transcoding.
    - `video-max-width` = set a max video width to downsize higher resolution video files. Aspect ratio will be preserved.
    - `h264-max-level` = set your max h264 level. Use the decimal format. Levels lower than the specified value, if otherwise appropriate, will be copied without transcoding. Example - `4.0`.
    - `pix_fmt` = set the video pix_fmt. If you don't know what this is just leave it blank.
    - `audio-codec` = set your desired audio codecs. May specify multiple comma separated values (ex: ac3, aac). The first value specified will be the default conversion choice when an undesired codec is encountered; any codecs specified here will be remuxed/copied rather than converted.
    - `audio-channel-bitrate` = set the bitrate for each audio channel. Default is 256. Setting this value to 0 will attempt to mirror the bitrate of the audio source, but this can be unreliable as bitrates vary between different codecs.
    - `audio-language` = 3 letter language code for audio streams you wish to copy. Leave blank to copy all. Separate multiple audio streams with commas (ex: eng,spa)
    - `audio-default-language` = If an audio stream with an unidentified/untagged language is detected, you can default that language tag to whatever this value is (ex: eng). This is useful for many single-audio releases which don't bother to tag the audio stream as anything
    - `audio-filter` = Applies FFMPEG audio filter. Make sure you specify all parameters as you would using the `-af` option with FFMPEG command line
    - `aac_adtstoasc` = Applies the aac_adtstoasc filter to AAC channels being copied. Useful if your source of mkv's uses raw ADTS AAC containers but can cause some playback issues with certain audio encoders
    - `audio-copy-original` = Copies the original audio stream to the destination regardless of codec to preserve it. Will not redundantly copy the steam if its already a valid/supported codec
    - `subtitle-codec` = set your desired subtitle codec. If you're embedding subs, `mov_text` is the only option supported. If you're creating external subtitle files, `srt` or `webvtt` are accepted.
    - `subtitle-language` = same as audio-language but for subtitles. Set to `nil` to disable copying of subtitles.
    - `subtitle-language-default` = same as audio-language-default but for subtitles
    - `convert-mp4` = forces the script to reprocess and convert mp4 files as though they were mkvs. Good if you have old mp4's that you want to match your current codec configuration. *Caution:* Set `ios-audio` to `False` when reprocessing files to avoid adding multiple iOS audio streams.
    - `fullpathguess` = True/False - When manually processing a file, enable to guess metadata using the full path versus just the file name. (Files shows placed in a 'Movies' folder will be recognized as movies, not as TV shows for example.)
    - `tagfile` = True/False - Enable or disable tagging file with appropriate metadata after encoding.
    - `tag-language` = en - Set your tag language for TMDB/TVDB entries metadata retrieval. Use either 2 or 3 character language codes.
    - `download-artwork` = Poster/Thumbnail/False - Enabled downloading and embeddeding of Season or Movie posters and embeddeding of that image into the mp4 as the cover image. For TV shows you may choose between the season artwork or the episode thumbnail by selecting the corresponding option.
    - `embed-subs` = True/False - Enabled by default. Embeds subtitles in the resulting MP4 file that are found embedded in the source file as well as external SRT/VTT files. Disabling embed-subs will cause the script to extract any subtitles that meet your language criteria into external SRT/VTT files. The script will also attempt to download SRT files if possible and this feature is enabled.
    - `embed-only-internal-subs` = True/False - Disabled by default. Embeds only internal subtitle tracks, will skip all external subtitles. *Caution:* `embed-subs` must be enabled for this option to work.
    - `download-subs` = True/False - When enabled the script will attempt to download subtitles of your specified languages automatically using subliminal and merge them into the final mp4 file.
    **YOU MUST INSTALL SUBLIMINAL AND ITS DEPENDENCIES FOR THIS TO WORK.** You must run `pip install subliminal` in order for this feature to be enabled.
    - `sub-providers` = Comma separated values for potential subtitle providers. Must specify at least 1 provider to enable `download-subs`. Providers include `podnapisi` `thesubdb` `opensubtitles` `tvsubtitles` `addic7ed`
    - `preopts` = Additional unsupported options that go before the rest of the FFMPEG parameters, comma separated (Example `-preset, medium`)
    - `postopts` = Additional unsupported options that go after the rest of the FFMEPG parameters, comma separated as above

Sickbeard Setup
--------------
1. Open Sickbeard's config.ini in Sick Beard installation folder
    - Set "extra_scripts" value in the general section to the full path to "python postConversion.py" using double backslashes
        - Example: `C:\\Python27\\python C:\\Scripts\\postConversion.py`
        - Make sure this is done while Sick Beard is not running or it will be reverted

    - `ssl` = 1 if enabled, 0 if not              #Settings/General/Security
    - `apikey` = Radarr API Key (required)        #Settings/General/Security
    - `web_root` = URL base empty or e.g. /tv     #Settings/General/Start-Up
2. Browse to the Settings>Download Client tab and enable advanced settings [Show].
3. Set the Drone Factory Interval' to 0 to disable it, and disable 'Completed Download Handling' in Radarr settings. The script will trigger a specific path re-scan, allowing the mp4 conversion to be completed before Radarr starts moving stuff around. This step is optional if you do not desire any processing between the downloading by whichever downloader you choose (NZB or Torrent), but is required if you wish to convert the file to an MP4 before it is handed back to Radarr.

    - Nonwindows Users
      - `Path` - Full path to `postRadarr.py`
      - `Arguments` - Leave blank

CouchPotato Setup
--------------
1. Set your CouchPotato settings to the autoProcess.ini file
    - `host` - default `localhost` - CouchPotato host address
    - `port` - default `5050` - CouchPotato port (5050)
    - `ssl` - `1` if enabled, `0` if not
    - `api_key` - CouchPotato API Key
    - `username` - your CouchPotato username
    - `password` - your CouchPotato password
2. Edit `main.py` in the `setup\PostProcess` folder
    - Set the path variable to the script location
    - By default it points to `C:\\Scripts\\`
    - Use double backslahses
2. Copy the PostProcess directory from the setup folder included with this script to the CouchPotato `custom_plugins` directory
    - Navigate to the About page in CouchPotato, where the installation directory is displayed.
    - Go to this folder and copy the PostProcess folder (the whole folder, not just the contents) to the CouchPotato `custom_plugins` directory
    - Delete any `.pyc` files you find.
    - Restart CouchPotato
    - Verify in CouchPotato logs that PostProcess was loaded.
3. If you're using one of the post download scripts ([SAB|NZBGet|uTorrent|deluge]PostProcess.py), disable automatic checking of the renamer folder, the script will automatically notify CouchPotato when it is complete to check for new videos to be renamed and relocated. Leaving this on may cause conflicts and CouchPotato may try to relocate/rename the file before processing is completed.
    - Set `Run Every` to `0`
    - Set `Force Every` to `0`
    - If you aren't using one of these scripts and are using an unsupported downloader, you will need to have CouchPotato periodically check the folder for files, otherwise the post downloader scripts will manually trigger a renamer scan. Using manual triggers is helpful because it prevents a coincidental renamer scan during other processing events.
4. Configure Downloaders
    - In `Settings > Downloaders` configure your labels or categories to match what you have configured in your respective downloader.

Plex Notification
--------------
Send a Plex notification as the final step when all processing is completed. This feature prevents a file from being flagged as "in use" by Plex before processing has completed.
1. Disable automatic refreshing on your Plex server
    - `Settings > Server > Library` and disable `Update my library automatically` and `Update my library periodically`.
2. Configure autoProcess.ini

The script suite supports the ability to write your own post processing scripts that will be executed when all the final processing has been completed. All scripts in the `./post_process` directory will be executed if the `post-process` option is set to `True` in `autoProcess.ini`. Scripts within the `./post_process/resources` directory are protected from execution if additional script resources are required.

The following environmental variables are available for usage:
- `MH_FILES` - JSON Array of all files created by the post processing script. The first file in the array is the primary file, and any additional files are copies created by the copy-to option
- `MH_TVDBID` - TVDB ID if file processed was a TV show and this information is available
- `MH_SEASON` - Season number if file processed was a TV show
- `MH_EPISODE` - Episode number if files processed was a TV show
- `MH_IMDBID` - IMDB ID if file processed was a movie
A sample script as well as an OS X 'Add to iTunes' script (`iTunes.py`) have been provided.
*Special thanks to jzucker2 for providing much of the initial code for this feature*

Manual Script Usage
--------------
To run the script manually, simply run the manual.py file and follow the prompts it presents.

Examples
```
Movies (using IMDB ID):
manual.py -i mp4path -imdb imdbid
Example: manual.py -i "C:\The Matrix.mkv" -imdb tt0133093

Movies (using TMDB ID)
manual.py -i mp4path -tmdb tmdbid
Example: manual.py -i "C:\The Matrix.mkv" -tmdb 603

TV
manual.py -i mp4path -tv tvdbid -s season -e episode
Example: manual.py -i "C:\Futurama S03E10.mkv" -tv 73871‎ -s 3 -e 10

Auto Single File (will gather movie ID or TV show ID / season / spisode from the file name if possible)
manual.py -i mp4path -silent
Example: manual.py -i "C:\Futurama S03E10.mkv" -a

Directory (you will be prompted at each file for the type of file and ID)
manual.py -i directory_path
Example: manual.py -i C:\Movies

Automated Directory (The script will attempt to figure out appropriate tagging based on file name)
manual.py -i directory_path -a
Example: manual.py -i C:\Movies -a

Process a directory but manually specific TVDB ID (Good for shows that don't correctly match using the guess)
manual.py -i directory -a -tv tvdbid
Example: manual.py -i C:\TV\Futurama\ -a -tv 73871
```
You may also simply run `manual.py -i 'C:\The Matrix.mkv` and the script will prompt you for the missing information or attempt to guess based on the file name.
You may run the script with a `--auto` or `-a` switch, which will let the script guess the tagging information based on the file name, avoiding any need for user input. This is the most ideal option for large batch file operations.
The script may also be pointed to a directory, where it will process all files in the directory. If you run the script without the `-silent` switch, you will be prompted for each file with options on how to tag, to convert without tagging, or skip.

External Cover Art
--------------
To use your own cover art instead of what the script pulls from TMDB or TVDB, simply place an image file named cover.jpg or cover.png in the same directory as the input video before processing and it will be used.

Import External Subtitles
--------------
To import external subtitles, place the .srt file in the same directory as the file to be processed. The srt must have the same name as the input video file, as well as the 3 character language code for which the subtitle is. Subtitle importing obeys the langauge rules set in autoProcess.ini, so languages that aren't whitelisted will be ignored.

Naming example:
```
input mkv - The.Matrix.1999.mkv
subtitle srt - The.Matrix.1999.eng.srt
```

Common Errors
--------------
- `ImportError: No module named pkg_resources` - you need to install setuptools for python. See here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions
- Problems moving from downloader back to manager - you most likely haven't set up your categories correctly. The category options designated by SB/SR/CP/Sonarr need to match the ones set in your downloader either in the plugin options or in autoProcess.ini, and these categories ALL need to execute either SABPostProcess.py for SAB or NZBGetPostProcess.py for NZBGet. Make sure they match.
