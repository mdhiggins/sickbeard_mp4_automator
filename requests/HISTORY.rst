History
-------

1.2.0 (2013-03-31)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed cookies on sessions and on requests
- Significantly change how hooks are dispatched - hooks now receive all the
  arguments specified by the user when making a request so hooks can make a
  secondary request with the same parameters. This is especially necessary for
  authentication handler authors
- certifi support was removed
- Fixed bug where using OAuth 1 with body ``signature_type`` sent no data
- Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication
  from the proxy url
- Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s
- Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes
- Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ``json.loads()`` via the
  ``Response.json()`` method
- Don't send ``Content-Length`` header by default on ``GET`` or ``HEAD``
  requests
- Add ``elapsed`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to time how long a request
  took.
- Fix ``RequestsCookieJar``
- Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the
  multiprocessing library
- Update charade to version 1.0.3

The change in how hooks are dispatched will likely cause a great deal of
issues.
