Requests: HTTP for Humans
=========================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

Requests is an :ref:`Apache2 Licensed <apache2>` HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.

Python's standard **urllib2** module provides most of
the HTTP capabilities you need, but the API is thoroughly **broken**.
It was built for a different time — and a different web. It requires an *enormous* amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks.

Things shouldn’t be this way. Not in Python.

::

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    u'{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {u'private_gists': 419, u'total_private_repos': 77, ...}

See `similar code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.

Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP/1.1 — making your integration with web services seamless. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100%  automatic, powered by `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, which is embedded within Requests.

**Armin Ronacher**
    Requests is the perfect example how beautiful an API can be with the
    right level of abstraction.

**Matt DeBoard**
    I'm going to get @kennethreitz's Python requests module tattooed
    on my body, somehow. The whole thing.

**Daniel Greenfeld**
    Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to
    @kennethreitz's request library. Today has been AWESOME.

**Kenny Meyers**
    Python HTTP: When in doubt, or when not in doubt, use Requests. Beautiful,
    simple, Pythonic.
